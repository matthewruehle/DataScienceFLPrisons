### Murder, Ink

##### Joey Maalouf, Matthew Ruehle, Sean Carter

We examine the claims made in an [Economist article](http://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21712032-what-can-be-learned-prisoners-tattoos-statistical-analysis-art) on prison tattoos. Examining a [publicly-available inmate database](http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/obis_request.html), we found that there are several noticeable trends between tattoos and types of criminal conviction. Our results are not necessarily causative, and may reflect either societal biases or demographic trends. Nonetheless, the data demonstrates a strong correlation between "ink" and criminal classifications.
